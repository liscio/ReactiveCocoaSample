# ReactiveCocoa Sample UI Code

I've been meaning to put together some sample code to demonstrate ReactiveCocoa in use, and some recent discussions on the ReactiveSwift and ReactiveCocoa repositories has pushed me to create it sooner.

Now we have a sandbox of sorts to experiment with the newer UI binding discussions that were triggered by the "big Rex merge," and hopefully this will turn into some kind of illustrative example code.

Currently it only targets the Mac, but I expect to demonstrate some cross-platform UI stuff I've done for my own products in the future.

## Building

First, you should update the submodules to get started. You can use Carthage for this, and type `carthage checkout --use-submodules` to get going. Using a standard carthage build will likely not work in this project, as it's not set up to grab the built products from `Carthage/Build`

Load the ReactiveCocoaSample.xcworkspace (not the .xcodeproj) and then everything *should* build okay.

## Contributing

Pull requests and issues are welcome, but I'm not here to explain/support ReactiveCocoa and ReactiveSwift. Please direct all those queries to their respective repositories.
